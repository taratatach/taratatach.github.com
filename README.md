You can display notes in another window during your presentation.
To do that, just replace script.js by script-note.js and link style-notes.css in your HTML file.
Add your note after the end of the section, but before the end of the div :

	</section>
	<footer class="notes">
		Your note here
	</footer>
</div></div>
	
After that, display the web console in Firefox (Tools, Web Developer, web console).
The web console can be displayed in another window, so you can move it on another screen.
